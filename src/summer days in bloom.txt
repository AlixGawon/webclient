Paralyzed by ancient delight
 And riding for a fall today
 I am dressed in style, so eager in mind
 But furthermore distracted by you

 And it's like I lose myself in dreaming of summer days in
 Bloom
 Oh, I've got no clue how I could fight that all that I am
 Is worth a dime
 Worth a dime

 This liquid lunch will not stop my punch-

 Drunk quality to doze while I run
 It is thirty-nine degrees in my mind
 It's thirty thousand miles more to go

 Cause it's like I lose myself in dreaming of summer days
 In bloom
 For I've got no clue whatever happened
 All that I am is worth a dime
 Worth a dime
